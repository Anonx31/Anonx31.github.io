                <h3>OverTheWire: Bandit 0</h3>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on May 11, 2023</p>
                <h4>Title: OverTheWire Bandit 0 Writeup: A Beginner's Journey to Mastering Linux Security</h4>
                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>In the vast realm of cybersecurity, there is a constant need to enhance one's knowledge and skills to
                    stay ahead of potential threats. OverTheWire is a fantastic platform that provides a series of
                    challenges designed to sharpen your skills in various aspects of computer security. One of the most
                    popular challenges on OverTheWire is Bandit, which takes you through a progressive journey of
                    mastering Linux security. In this writeup, we will explore Bandit Level 0 and unravel the mystery
                    behind it.</p>
                <h4>Level 0: Understanding the Basics</h4>
                <p>The first level of Bandit serves as an introduction to the challenge and acquaints you with the
                    platform's interface. Before diving into the challenges, let's take a moment to understand the
                    basics. Bandit is a wargame that allows users to connect to a remote server using Secure Shell
                    (SSH). The goal is to find the password for the next level by solving a series of puzzles or
                    exploiting security vulnerabilities.</p>
                <h3>Level 0 Walkthrough:</h3>
                <p>To start the challenge, we first need to establish an SSH connection to the Bandit server using the
                    provided credentials. In this case, the server address is <b>bandit.labs.overthewire.org</b>, and
                    the port is set to <b>2220</b>. We can establish the connection using the SSH command in the
                    terminal:</p>

                <p>Upon successful authentication, we enter the Bandit server, and we are greeted with a welcome
                    message. Our goal is to retrieve the password for the next level, which is stored in a file within
                    the home directory.</p>
                <p>Navigating through the directories in Linux is crucial, and we can achieve this using basic commands
                    like <b>ls</b> and <b>cd</b>. Once we are in the home directory, we can use the <b>ls</b> command to
                    list the files. In this case, there is only one file named <b>readme</b>.</p>
                <p>To view the contents of the <b>readme</b> file, we can use the <b>cat</b> command:</p>
                <img src="/assets/images/blog3-con2.PNG" alt="solutoin-of-problem" class="img-fluid">
                <p>This will display the content of the file, which is the password for the next level.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>Bandit Level 0 might seem like a straightforward challenge, but it sets the foundation for the
                    subsequent levels. By familiarizing ourselves with basic commands such as SSH, <b>ls</b>, <b>cd</b>,
                    and <b>cat</b>, we begin to understand the power of the Linux command-line interface. Each level in
                    Bandit introduces new concepts and techniques, allowing us to improve our Linux security skills
                    along the way.</p>
                <p>OverTheWire's Bandit is an excellent platform for beginners to dive into the world of cybersecurity.
