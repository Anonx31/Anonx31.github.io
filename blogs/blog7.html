                <h3>OverTheWire: Bandit 2</h3>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on May 17, 2023</p>
                <h4>Title: OverTheWire Bandit 2 Writeup: Unlocking Secrets Beyond File Names</h4>
                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>As we continue our exploration of OverTheWire's Bandit challenge, we advance to Level 2, where we
                    encounter new challenges that push the boundaries of our Linux security knowledge. In this writeup,
                    we will unravel the mysteries of Bandit Level 2, expanding our understanding of file manipulation
                    techniques and reinforcing our command-line skills.</p>
                <h4>Level 2: Decoding Hidden File Content</h4>
                <p>Level 2 introduces us to the concept of file names containing spaces, which can sometimes complicate
                    file manipulation tasks. We need to adapt our approach and utilize appropriate techniques to work
                    with such files effectively.</p>
                <p>To begin, we establish an SSH connection to the Bandit server using the provided credentials. The
                    server address remains <b>bandit.labs.overthewire.org</b>, and the port remains <b>2220</b>.
                    Let's initiate the SSH connection:</p>
                <img src="/assets/images/blog7-con1.PNG" alt="solution-of-problem" class="img-fluid">
                <p>After successful authentication, we find ourselves in the home directory of the Bandit server. Our
                    objective is to discover the password for the next level, which is stored within a file named
                    <b>spaces in this filename</b>.
                </p>
                <p>To list the contents of the directory, we can use the <b>ls</b> command:</p>
                <img src="/assets/images/blog7-con2.PNG" alt="solution-of-problem" class="img-fluid">
                <p>We notice the presence of the file <b>spaces in this filename</b>. However, attempting to view its
                    contents directly using the <b>cat</b> command may result in errors due to the spaces in the file
                    name.</p>
                <p>To overcome this challenge, we can enclose the file name in single quotes or escape the spaces with
                    backslashes. Let's use single quotes in this case:
                </p>
                <img src="/assets/images/blog7-con3.PNG" alt="solution-of-problem" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Executing this command displays the content of the file, ultimately revealing the password for Level
                    3.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>Bandit Level 2 presents us with a new hurdle—file names containing spaces. By adapting our file
                    manipulation techniques and utilizing single quotes, we overcome this obstacle and successfully
                    access the file's content. This level reinforces the importance of understanding how to navigate and
                    interact with different file name formats in Linux.</p>
                <p>OverTheWire's Bandit challenge provides an excellent platform for honing our Linux security skills.
                    As we progress through the levels, we encounter various scenarios that demand creative thinking and
                    mastery of command-line tools like SSH, <b>ls</b>, and <b>cat</b>.</p>
                <p>If you are eager to deepen your Linux security expertise, I encourage you to embark on the Bandit
                    challenge. Brace yourself for thrilling adventures, where you'll unlock secrets hidden within
                    complex file systems and gain practical knowledge that will prove invaluable in your cybersecurity
                    journey.</p>
                <p>Remember to embrace each challenge, learn from your experiences, and persist in your pursuit of
                    mastery. So, don't hesitate—dive into Bandit Level 2 and unveil the concealed truths beyond file
                    names in the Linux realm.</p>
