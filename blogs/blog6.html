                <h3>OverTheWire: Bandit 1</h3>
                <p class="post-date">Posted on May 15, 2023</p>
                <h4>Title: OverTheWire Bandit 1 Writeup: Advancing Through the Linux Security Maze</h4>
                <h3>Introduction:</h3>
                <p>Continuing our journey through OverTheWire's Bandit challenge, we move on to Level 1, where the
                    puzzles become more intriguing, testing our Linux security skills even further. In this writeup, we
                    will delve into the details of Bandit Level 1, uncovering the secrets it holds and gaining valuable
                    insights along the way.</p>
                <h4>Level 1: The Hunt for Hidden Files</h4>
                <p>Level 1 introduces the concept of hidden files, which are files that are not displayed by default
                    when listing the contents of a directory. These files are typically preceded by a dot (.), making
                    them invisible unless explicitly shown.</p>
                <p>To begin, we establish an SSH connection to the Bandit server using the credentials provided. As in
                    the previous level, the server address is <b>bandit.labs.overthewire.org</b>, and the port remains
                    at <b>2220</b>. Let's initiate the SSH connection:</p>

                <p>After successful authentication, we find ourselves in the Bandit server's home directory. Our
                    objective is to locate the password for the next level, which is hidden within a file.</p>
                <p>To view the contents of the home directory, we can use the <b>ls</b> command:</p>


                <p>Here, we notice a file named <b>-</b>, which is not a typical filename. However, it is essential to
                    remember that in Linux, the dash ("-") can represent the current directory.</p>
                <p>To access the contents of this file, we can utilize the <b>cat</b> command along with the explicit
                    path:</p>
                <img src="/assets/images/blog6-con3.PNG" alt="solutoin-of-problem" class="img-fluid">
                <p>Executing this command displays the contents of the file, revealing the password for Level 2.</p>


                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>Bandit Level 1 builds upon the foundation established in the previous level, challenging us to think
                    outside the box and explore hidden files. By leveraging our knowledge of Linux commands such as SSH,
                    <b>ls</b>, and <b>cat</b>, we expand our understanding of Linux security and enhance our
                    problem-solving abilities.
                </p>
                <p>OverTheWire's Bandit provides an engaging platform for individuals seeking to enhance their
                    cybersecurity skills. As we progress through the levels, we gain hands-on experience, sharpening our
                    command-line proficiency and developing a deeper understanding of Linux security principles.</p>
                <p>If you are enthusiastic about strengthening your Linux security expertise, I encourage you to embark
                    on the Bandit challenge. Prepare yourself for an exciting adventure filled with intriguing puzzles
                    and valuable lessons. Remember to embrace the journey, persevere through challenges, and
                    continuously expand your knowledge.</p>
                <p>So, don't hesitateâ€”dive into Bandit Level 1 and unravel the mysteries hidden within Linux's security maze.
